# Calculation of business indicators
 In the course of the work, an analysis of such business indicators as user conversion, user retention, LTV, ROI and CAC was carried out. 
 Based on these data , a number of conclusions can be drawn: 
 1. Revenues from users on Android, Mac and iPhone do not differ, unlike low income from PC.  However, the cost of advertising on Mac and iPhone devices is much higher than on other devices. Advertising hardly pays off only on a PC device. 
 2. Users from the USA bring in more revenue on average than users from other countries. At the same time, the cost of advertising aimed at users from the United States is many times higher than in other countries. In addition, such advertising (only in the USA) does not pay off. 
 3. Users who came thanks to the lambdaMediaAds and TipTop advertising source bring in the most revenue on average. However, the cost of attracting users thanks to the TipTop source is many times higher and advertising does not pay off for TipTop. 
 4. Users use the application longer if they have registered: 
 a) Devices: PC, 
 b) countries: United Kingdom, France, Germany, 
 c) advertising sources: all except FaceBoom and AdNonSense (for paying users). 
 Recommendations: 
 1. You can abandon the promotion of the application on Apple platform devices and focus on PC and Android. 
 2. You can abandon the promotion of the application in the USA and focus on other countries. 
 3. You can refuse to promote the application by the advertising source TipTop and FaseBoom.
