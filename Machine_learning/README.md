The network of fitness centers "culture" develops a strategy of interaction with customers based on analytical data. A common problem of fitness clubs and other services is the outflow of customers. In order to combat the outflow, the customer service department of the "Data Scientist Bodybuilder" has converted a lot of client questionnaires into electronic form. The main task is to analyze and prepare an action plan for customer retention.
Based on the data obtained , the following conclusions were made:

1. Carrying out the "bring a friend" campaign
2. To strengthen advertising for the purchase of a subscription for a year (discounts, promotions)
3. To focus clients' attention on other fitness center services (cafes, sporting goods, beauty and massage parlors)
