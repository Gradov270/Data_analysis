# Data_analysis
There are my projects on data analysis. I prepared decisions for problems in machine learning, A/B-testing, design of dashboard, statistic analysis and e.t.c..
The repository contains the following topics: 
1. analysis of business indicators for attracting users through an advertising campaign (Business indicators https://github.com/Gradov270/Data_analysis/tree/main/Business%20indicators), 
2. visualization of the history of user interactions with articles on different topics, from different sources, different age groups in time (Dashboard_analysis https://github.com/Gradov270/Data_analysis/tree/main/Dashboard_analysis), 
3. event analytics to identify a positive result when changing the design of the application (A_B_testing https://github.com/Gradov270/Data_analysis/tree/main/A_B_testing),
4. prediction of customer churn due to various factors (Machine_learning https://github.com/Gradov270/Data_analysis/tree/main/Machine_learning).
